Monorepo + CI improvements and package layout updates:

- Migrate CI to pnpm workspaces to fix installs and caching, ensuring Actions pass reliably.
- Align release pipeline with Changesets and pnpm for consistent versioning and publishing.
- Continue migration of core package layout toward `packages/aggo` to simplify multi-package development.
- Documentation and configuration cleanups to match the new structure.

No API breakages are expected; this is a housekeeping release to align tooling and repo structure.

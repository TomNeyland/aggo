BREAKING: Monorepo restructure and release pipeline changes

- Migrate to pnpm workspaces and align release tooling. This changes the package publishing layout so all packages are released from `packages/*`.
- Root package is now private; consumers should depend on `aggo` as usual, but the published artifact originates from `packages/aggo`.
- Internal package relationships are updated to workspace-aware configs.

Other improvements:

- Migrate CI to pnpm workspaces to fix installs and caching, ensuring Actions pass reliably.
- Align release pipeline with Changesets and pnpm for consistent versioning and publishing.
- Continue migration of core package layout toward `packages/aggo` to simplify multi-package development.
- Documentation and configuration cleanups to match the new structure.

If you pin exact versions, update to ^1.0.0 for all packages.

## Failure Analysis by Type

### 1. **Type Error: `pipeline.some is not a function`**

**Files Affected:**
- `aggregation.spec.js` (3 failures)

**Error Details:**
```
TypeError: pipeline.some is not a function
  at canUseHotPath (src/modash/hot-path-aggregation.ts:114:29)
  at hotPathAggregate (src/modash/hot-path-aggregation.ts:452:7)
  at optimizedAggregate (src/modash/index.ts:42:10)
```

**Affected Tests:**
- "should include specific fields from embedded documents using dot notation"
- "should include specific fields from embedded documents using object notation" 
- "should include computed fields"

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The `canUseHotPath` function expects `pipeline` to be an array with the `.some()` method, but it's receiving a non-array value. This suggests that:
1. Pipeline transformation/validation is not properly converting the input to an array
2. The hot-path optimization logic has a type mismatch
3. There may be an issue with how the pipeline parameter is passed or processed

**Impact:** Critical - prevents certain $project operations from functioning

---

### 2. **Ordering/Non-Deterministic Results**

**Files Affected:**
- `aggregation.spec.js` (3 failures)
- `streaming-comparison.spec.js` (3 failures)

**Error Type:** Object/array ordering differences in results

**Examples:**

**From aggregation.spec.js:**
```javascript
// Expected: ["abc", "jkl", "xyz"]
// Actual: ["xyz", "jkl", "abc"]
```

**From streaming-comparison.spec.js:**
```javascript
// Expected groups in different order
// Streaming vs non-streaming produces different ordering
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Lack of deterministic ordering**: JavaScript objects and aggregation results don't guarantee insertion order
2. **Streaming vs Non-streaming inconsistency**: Different code paths produce results in different orders
3. **Missing sort operations**: Tests expect specific ordering but don't explicitly sort results
4. **Hash map iteration**: Object key iteration order varies between implementations

**Impact:** Moderate - functionality works but results are non-deterministic

---

### 3. **Streaming Collection Inconsistencies**

**Files Affected:**
- `streaming-comparison.spec.js` (9 failures)
- `streaming-removal.spec.js` (2 failures)
- `streaming.spec.js` (2 failures)
- `transparent-streaming.spec.js` (1 failure)

**Error Types:**

#### 3a. **Empty Results in Streaming Mode**
```javascript
// Non-streaming: [5 items]
// Streaming: []
```

#### 3b. **Field Processing Differences**
```javascript
// Non-streaming: {_id: 1, title: "abc123", author: {...}}
// Streaming: {_id: "Dante", books: [[null], [null], [null]]}
```

#### 3c. **Aggregation Result Mismatches**
```javascript
// Expected: {_id: null, count: 1, avgScore: 85}
// Actual: {_id: null, count: 1, avgScore: 100}
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Different execution engines**: Streaming uses different aggregation pipeline than non-streaming
2. **IVM engine fallbacks**: "IVM engine failed, falling back to standard aggregation" messages indicate optimization failures
3. **State management issues**: Streaming collections maintain state differently than one-shot aggregations
4. **Field resolution bugs**: Cross-stage field resolution works differently in streaming mode
5. **Event handling timing**: Async event processing affects result consistency

**Impact:** High - streaming functionality doesn't match non-streaming behavior

---

### 4. **Timeout Failures**

**Files Affected:**
- `phase3-optimization.spec.js` (1 failure)
- `streaming.spec.js` (1 failure)

**Error Details:**
```
Error: Timeout of 2000ms exceeded. For async tests and hooks, ensure "done()" is called; if returning a Promise, ensure it resolves.
```

**Affected Tests:**
- "should handle high-throughput delta operations"
- "should handle rapid event bursts without memory leaks"

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Infinite loops or deadlocks**: Code gets stuck in processing loops
2. **Memory leak prevention**: Tests designed to detect memory leaks may hang
3. **Async callback issues**: Missing `done()` calls or unresolved promises
4. **Performance bottlenecks**: Operations taking longer than expected under test conditions

**Impact:** Moderate - performance and memory management features affected

---

### 5. **Data Corruption/Transformation Issues**

**Files Affected:**
- `aggregation.spec.js` (2 failures)
- `streaming-comparison.spec.js` (multiple)

**Error Examples:**

#### 5a. **$$ROOT System Variable Issues**
```javascript
// Expected: Complete document objects
// Actual: [null] arrays instead of documents
```

#### 5b. **Field Projection Problems**
```javascript
// Expected: {_id: 1, title: "abc123", author: {...}}
// Actual: {_id: "Dante", books: [[null], [null], [null]]}
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **$$ROOT variable implementation**: The system variable that refers to the entire document is not working correctly
2. **Document reference corruption**: Field expressions that should return full documents return null
3. **Pipeline stage leakage**: Results from previous pipeline stages contaminate subsequent stages
4. **Memory reference issues**: Document objects may be getting garbage collected or corrupted

**Impact:** High - core aggregation functionality broken for complex operations

---

### 6. **Event Source Management Failures**

**Files Affected:**
- `streaming.spec.js` (1 failure)

**Error Details:**
```javascript
// Expected: 5 events processed
// Actual: 4 events processed
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Race conditions**: Event processing timing issues
2. **Event source lifecycle**: Start/stop/restart operations not working correctly
3. **Event counting bugs**: Events may be dropped or double-counted
4. **Consumer management**: Event consumer registry issues

**Impact:** Moderate - streaming event processing reliability affected

---

### 7. **Expression Evaluation Failures**

**Files Affected:**
- `streaming-comparison.spec.js` (1 failure)

**Error Details:**
```
IVM engine failed, falling back to standard aggregation: expr.$and.every is not a function
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **IVM (Isolated-VM) engine bugs**: The performance-optimized VM execution environment has compatibility issues
2. **Expression method availability**: JavaScript methods not available in isolated context
3. **Operator implementation gaps**: Some operators not properly implemented in IVM engine
4. **Fallback mechanism inconsistency**: Standard aggregation produces different results than IVM

**Impact:** High - performance optimization features unreliable

---

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### Priority 1: Type Safety Issues
- **`pipeline.some is not a function`** errors block core functionality
- Fix hot-path aggregation type checking and parameter validation

### Priority 2: Streaming vs Non-Streaming Parity
- **Streaming collections produce different results** than non-streaming
- Ensure identical behavior between execution modes
- Fix IVM engine fallback inconsistencies

### Priority 3: Data Integrity Issues  
- **$$ROOT system variable** returns null instead of documents
- **Field projection corruption** in multi-stage pipelines
- **Cross-stage field resolution** problems

## Recommendations

1. **Add comprehensive integration tests** that compare streaming vs non-streaming results for all operations
2. **Implement deterministic ordering** for aggregation results or update tests to handle unordered results
3. **Fix IVM engine compatibility** or improve fallback mechanisms
4. **Enhance type safety** in pipeline processing and hot-path optimization
5. **Add timeout handling** for performance tests to prevent infinite loops
6. **Implement proper cleanup** for streaming collections and event sources

## Test Environment Details

- **Node.js Version**: 18+
- **Test Runner**: Mocha with tsx/esm loader
- **Timeout Setting**: 60 seconds per test file
- **TypeScript**: Native execution via tsx (no compilation)
- **Total Test Execution Time**: ~15 seconds for all test files combined

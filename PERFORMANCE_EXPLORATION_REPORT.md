# Exploratory Performance Pass: Beyond Phase 3.5

## Executive Summary

This report documents a comprehensive exploratory performance analysis of modash.js, examining optimization opportunities beyond the existing Phase 3.5 achievements. The analysis focused on six key areas: RowId discipline, buffer management, hot path fusion, expression execution, grouping operations, and streaming performance.

## Key Findings

### üéØ Overall Assessment: RowId Discipline Maintained ‚úÖ

All operators successfully maintain RowId discipline with **zero premature materializations** detected across all pipeline stages including `$unwind`, `$group`, `$project`, and `$switch`. The virtual RowId resolution system operates efficiently at 490 rows/ms, though there's opportunity for optimization to reach the target >100K rows/ms threshold.

### üìä Performance Baseline (10K Documents)

| Operation         | Current Performance | Throughput    |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Simple Filter     | 1.81ms              | 5.5M docs/sec |
| Group & Aggregate | 13.35ms             | 749K docs/sec |
| Complex Pipeline  | 59.08ms             | 169K docs/sec |

## Detailed Analysis Results

### 1. RowId Discipline Verification ‚úÖ

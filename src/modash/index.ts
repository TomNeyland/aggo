 * Modern MongoDB-inspired aggregation library for TypeScript.

 * STREAMING-FIRST EXECUTION ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Defaults to IVM/streaming engine for maximum performance
 * - Minimal compatibility shim for truly unsupported operators:
 *   â€¢ $function, $where (arbitrary JavaScript execution)
 *   â€¢ $merge, $out (side-effect stages)
 *   â€¢ Advanced $lookup with pipeline/let (multi-collection joins)
 * - All other operations use zero-allocation streaming engine
 * - Standard aggregation engine deprecated, replaced with minimal shim
 *
 * Provides transparent streaming support - all aggregations automatically
 * work with both regular arrays and streaming collections.
